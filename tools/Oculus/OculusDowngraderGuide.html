                        No. You're downloading from Oculus servers and those check that you own the game

                    <div class="attention" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">

                            Important info about tokens
                        </div>
                        Your token is something private. Anyone who has it can download apps, send messages, ... with your name.
                        <br/>But then the question comes why do I give it Oculus downgrader? Oculus downgrader needs to authenticate the download with oculus and do requests to oculus api so it needs your token. After you entered the token it gets stored locally and encrypted on your PC and ONLY shared with an official tool by Oculus to download rift apps.

                    <div class="tip" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        <div class="tipHeader">
                            Why does Oculus downgrader need administrative permissions?
                        </div>
                        Oculus does not allow rift applications to run from a place other than their libary folder which is located in Program files (which needs administrative permissions to modify). So to move all the files in that folder Oculus downgrader needs administrative permissions.
                        <br/>If you have further concern you can ask me on Discord or read <a href="https://github.com/ComputerElite/Oculus-downgrader">the source code</a>.

                        Every time you can put something in it'll ask you a question in Blue. Write the answer (which is often <code>y</code> or <code>n</code>) and press enter to confirm your input. If you don't know what the question means you can generally press enter and it'll do what most people want it to do.

                        Download and install the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-6.0.3-windows-x64-installer">NET 6 runtime</a>. After that you should be able to start it again.

                        You can download the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/ComputerElite/Oculus-downgrader/releases/latest">here</a>. Download the zip, extract it and run the program.

                    <div class="header">Logging in</div>
                    <div class="step">
                        Why do you even need to log in? Well you got to authenticate that you own the app you want to downgrade.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When first starting Oculus Downgrader you should be asked to log in. If you aren't just use option 5 to log in.
                        <br>
                        You can log in in 2 ways:
                        <br>
                        <b>Facebook</b>
                        <br>
                        Microsoft edge will open and take you to the oculus site. On there press the person at the top right to log in (if you don't see a person press the menu button at the top left and then login). Continue to login with your oculus/facebook account. After you've logged in you're done. Now in Oculus Downgrader you have to choose a password to encrypt your token (basically a temporary passwort to log into your account). Put a password in (8 characters or more; choose one you haven't used anywhere else) and confirm with enter. You're now in the menu!
                        <br>
                        <b>If Oculus Downgrader crashs when you try to log in use your token to login (see below))</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Token</b>
                        <br>
                        Press <code>n</code> when it asks you if you want to login with facebook. Then press <code>y</code> to get a guide for getting your token. Put your token in, set a password which you haven't used anywhere and done.
                    </div>
                    <div class="header">For all other stuff</div>
                    <div class="step">
                        in the menu select what you want to do (put in the number of the option you want to do). Then just do what Oculus Downgrader tells you.
                    </div>
                    <div class="header">Need help?</div>
                    <div class="step">
                        Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/zwRfHQN2UY">OculusDB Discord Server</a> and ask your question in <code>#support</code>
                    </div>

                    <div class="header">My game crashes when I launch it!</div>
                    <div class="step">
                        This is often due to a entitlement check error. Usually this is user error in the downgrader setup and can be easily resolved:<br/>
                        First open your oculus app on your PC and go into settings. There go to <code>general</code> and click <code>library location</code>. Note one of the entries down (an example can be <code>D:\Oculus</code>)<br/>
                        Then open Oculus downgrader and choose option <code>6</code>. In there put what you saw in the oculus app (in our example it is <code>D:\Oculus</code> but it may vary for you).<br/>
                        You should now be able to launch your game without crashing.
